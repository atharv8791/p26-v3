Knead by hand or beat the dough with your mixer. I like doing this by hand and you can watch me in the video.
Place dough into a greased mixing bowl, cover tightly, and set aside to rise for about 90 minutes or overnight in the refrigerator.
Punch down risen dough to release air bubbles. Divide in 2.
Roll dough out into a 12-inch circle. Cover and rest as you prep the pizza toppings.
Top with favorite pizza toppings.
Bake pizza at a very high temperature for only about 15 minutes.
